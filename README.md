# Procedural-Generation
This repository contains the code for two different procedural generation methods I utilized while exploring dynamic terrain generation in unity. One of these methods is a simplistic, stylized terrain generation method while the other utilizes an algorithm known as 'Marching Cubes' to create more detailed and realistic looking terrain.

### Marching Cubes Method

The marching cubes algorithm works by dividing the desired area into equal sized cubes. Using a three dimensional variant of perlin noise, the program checks which of these cubes are above ground and which are below ground. 

### Manual Method

My initial method of procedural generation was accomplished by directly assigning each point for the triangles that would compose the terrain.
